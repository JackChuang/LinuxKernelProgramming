Our phase2 & phase3 implementations are in prototype-serial & prototype-parallel separately. prototype-parallel is the vanilla implementation in tour report. Scripts used for geting performance data are in data_collection.

---------- Project 6 Limitation List ---------- 
MANDATORY:Cannot update an existing key with another value, cannot delete a key/value couple

Pick 2 of remaining:
>Read Latency: need to scan the entire flash -> needs indexing. True for mount time too. Also
true for write as we need to check that we are not inserting a duplicate key

>Cache in RAM (O)
>No particular wear leveling (O)
>Bit-flips: handled by the driver, what if block becomes bad? No bad block management
>Only one key/value couple in a single flash page
>Cannot write a couple with size (key+value) > flash page size
>No concurrency (O)
>No permissions and users management
